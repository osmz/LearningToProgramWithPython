# LearningToProgramWithPython

Steve Jobs said that “everyone should learn to program a computer because it helps you think”. Currently, programming has become a fundamental tool for the development of modern technology. This project introduces you to the world of programming in the Python language. In a practical way, going through the basic treatment of variables to the programming of algorithms to build your own games. Additionally, it will familiarize you with the fundamental concepts for the development of algorithms and their programming.

One of the objectives at the end of the course is to be able to develop your own programs in Python and to continue exploring to build new, increasingly complex programs. This project is part of the first step to become a professional with basic programming skills and open the door to the future.
